Tutorial about how to create your WordPress site on Alibaba Cloud using their free trial.

* The first think you need of course is an account, create your and then follow me.

## Creating the free trial.

Once you have created your account and added a card, is time to use the free trial. Go to https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/free?_p_lc=1&TargetUserType=for-enterprise

And select the ECS t5 Instance (1C1G 1 Year).

3. You can select your Customer Password or use a Key Pair, I'll use a custom password as is beginner-friendly.

Let the other things as default (or you can't use the free trial)

The command you will need is `SSH root@YOUR_IP`, once you enter this it will ask you for your fingerprint, type yes, and then type your password (that you use to create your ECS).
