This is the direct link: https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/home

We can see one running ECS instance in the region which you set, in my case US (silicon Valley)



Select "instances" in the left menu bar:

#### SSH
The command you will need is `SSH root@YOUR_IP`, once you enter this it will ask you for your fingerprint, type yes, and then type your password (that you use to create your ECS).

After logging on to the ECS with SSH, run the apt update command to update apt source: 
`` apt update ``
<img width="960" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108bd37e-ec4d-439c-aa5e-1b7ef6d97cbc" />

Install the MySQL service and client:
`` apt install -y mysql-server mysql-client ``
<img width="960" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38bb01c7-80fa-42a0-ba86-378faef43e19" />

During installation, you will be prompted to enter a password for MySQL. Memorize this password, because later it will be used for connecting to MySQL.

Start the MySQL service:
`` service mysql start ``

<img width="847" height="64" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40bf695e-e89c-44f7-9342-db0136947fb6" />

Enter the following command, and then enter the password you set when installing the MySQL service. A successful logon represents a successful installation:
`` mysql -uroot -p ``

<img width="842" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e041f611-63d9-42e8-bbfb-247dcec6176d" />

When you are logged on, create a WordPress database in MySQL:
``CREATE DATABASE wordpress; ``
Exit MySQL:
`` exit; ``

Install the Nginx, PHP 7.0-FPM, and PHP 7.0-MySQL packages:
`` apt install -y nginx php7.0-fpm php7.0-mysql ``

<img width="834" height="665" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b8ab46f-8bee-4c0a-a7b0-c5452ba33254" />

Start the Nginx Web service:
`` service nginx restart ``

When Nginx is started, enter the EIP bound to the ECS in your browser, and the following screen appears:
<img width="571" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d41f8c8-ed52-4def-bd3d-699e9a62803c" />

4 Download the WordPress installation package
Download the WordPress installation package:
`` wget https://labex-ali-data.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/wordpress/wordpress-6.1.1.tar.gz ``

<img width="1590" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ba0e3f-2b94-488a-a897-6c98fe196387" />

Unzip the WordPress installation package to the /var/www directory.
`` tar -xzf wordpress-6.1.1.tar.gz -C /var/www/ ``

Change the directory permission to www-data users and user groups.
`` chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www ``

5. Modify the Nginx configuration file
Before editing an important configuration file, it is best to back up the file in advance to prevent the error operation can not be restored:
`` cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.bak ``

Using vim to edit and modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-available/default as follows:
`` vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default ``

server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/wordpress;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;


    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/www;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;

        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
          include /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;
    }
}


Go to the /var/www/wordpress directory, copy wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, and then modify wp-config.php with vim:

`` cp /var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php ``

`` vim /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php ``

Configure the database connection information in the file, as shown in the following figure:

Restart Nginx and PHP 7.0-FPM:
``service nginx restart``

``service php7.0-fpm restart``

6. WordPress welcome screen
Enter the following address in your browser. Make sure you enter the EIP address for the IP address. If that directs you to the language selection screen, it means that WordPress is installed successfully.

http://<EIP address>/wp-admin/install.php
